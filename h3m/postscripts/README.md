postscripts are supposed to be small scripts that take as input an already existing
map (can be any map, a standard H3 map, a map generated with the AB/SoD RMG, 
a community map or one made with h3mtools RMG) and then modifies it in some way.

Example ideas for postscripts:
*Fix broken underground roads. See http://i.imgur.com/IFesQXj.jpg
*Fix wrongly places guards. See http://i.imgur.com/dn3IEO9.png
*Put a sign at nearest possible tile outside each Witch Hut saying which skill is taught
*Ban certain buildings from all towns, such as all creature dwellings
*Replace spell scrolls with gold
*Remove/add artifacts, resources, etc

Each postscript should ideally do only one type of thing so that one or several can be
run as needed to get desired results.
