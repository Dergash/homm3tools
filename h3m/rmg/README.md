RMG using the phlm interface. The overall idea is that there should be many
"modules" of which one can be chosen and run to generate a map. These modules
can generate different types of map, ranging from standard Heroes III maps
such as the ones in the AB/SoD RMG to such maps with other victory conditions to
maps that completely go away from the standard Heroes III concept.

Examples of ideas:
*Map similar to Magic the Gathering in which players take turns to draft creatures
stacks from a pool. Possibly also artifacts, spells and skills would be drafted.

*Rogue-like maps meant for singleplayer: maps similar to the ones in Nethack are generated. 
Could have a multitude of victory conditions such as defeating a specific monster or 
obtaining a specific artifact. 

*Randomly generated Zelda-like maps meant for singleplayer: Dungeons are generated (using Underground) 
which end with boss fights and obtaining that dungeons artifact, which could be the objective of a 
Seer's hut quest. Doesn't necessarily include towns at all.

*Capture The Flag meant for multiplayer: Rough idea is that the victory condition is to
capture a specific artifact (and possibly transport it to a specific town).

*Zone control meant for multiplayer: Rough idea is that the way 
to win is to achieve a certain number of "points" which are obtained through controlling towns. 
Needs to be investigated to see if it is possible/exactly how to implement it but the basic
idea is to used timed events in towns.
